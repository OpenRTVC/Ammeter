![Precision Ammeter Shield](https://github.com/smakonin/raw/master/Sheild/photo.jpg?raw=true) "Precision Ammeter Shield")

This ammeter and measure up to 4 current transformers (CT). One CT per analog pin. Any CT that outputs 333 mV can be used, but that shield was tested with split-core CTS from DENT Instruments (http://www.dentinstruments.com/split_core_mini_midi_ct_current_transformers.html). We purchased the CTs from http://www.powermeterstore.com.
