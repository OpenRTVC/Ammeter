This ammeter can measure up to 4 current transformers (CT). One CT per analog pin. Any CT that outputs 333 mV can be used, but that shield was tested with split-core CTS from [DENT Instruments](http://www.dentinstruments.com/split_core_mini_midi_ct_current_transformers.html). We purchased the CTs from http://www.powermeterstore.com.
